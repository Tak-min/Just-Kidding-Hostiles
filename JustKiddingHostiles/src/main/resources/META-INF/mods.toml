"Ever wish those monsters were a bit more... friendly?"

If so, this is the mod for you!
This mod adds "Just Kidding Hostiles" to your world!

They may look just like the fearsome monsters you know, but their nature is completely different.
They might approach you when they see you, but not to attackâ€”they're just curious!

Our first addition is the "Mini Zombie."
It's a tiny, harmless zombie that will toddle along behind you.

We plan to add many more "just kidding" friends in future updates!
Please enjoy a Minecraft world that's a little less scary and a lot more cute.
